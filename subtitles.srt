1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,460
IN THE QUIET

2
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:01,620
MOMENTS, WHEN THE

3
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:02,839
WORLD OUTSIDE SOFTENS

4
00:00:02,839 --> 00:00:04,000
ITS EDGES, WE

5
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:04,700
FIND EACH OTHER.

6
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:05,559
IT'S IN THE

7
00:00:05,559 --> 00:00:06,679
SHARED GLINTS, THE

8
00:00:06,679 --> 00:00:07,459
GENTLE TOUCH THAT

9
00:00:07,459 --> 00:00:08,839
LINGERS, A SILENT

10
00:00:08,839 --> 00:00:10,039
PROMISE WHISPERED BETWEEN

11
00:00:10,039 --> 00:00:10,400
SOULS.

12
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:11,599
THIS ISN'T ABOUT

13
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,060
GRAND GESTURES, BUT

14
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:14,039
THE QUIET SYMPHONY

15
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:15,060
OF UNDERSTANDING THAT

16
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:15,859
PLAYS WHEN TWO

17
00:00:15,859 --> 00:00:16,760
HEARTS TRULY ALIGN,

18
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,059
A WARMTH SETTLES,

19
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,460
A PEACEFUL KNOWING

20
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:20,000
THAT IN THIS

21
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,320
CONNECTION, IN THIS

22
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,579
TENDER EMBRACE, WE

23
00:00:22,579 --> 00:00:23,839
ARE HOME, CHERISHED,

24
00:00:24,219 --> 00:00:25,280
SEEN, AND UTTERLY,

25
00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:26,879
WONDERFULLY LOVED, JUST

26
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:27,460
AS WE ARE.
